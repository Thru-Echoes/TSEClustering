# Threshold Smoothing Ensemble Clustering (TSEClustering)

An unsupervised clustering method (currently in *R*) that uses observational dropouts and subsets of feature space to generate and aggregate similarity matrices into an ensemble. The final probability ensemble can have a threshold smoothing function applied to it in order to dropout low values of similarity between observations.
